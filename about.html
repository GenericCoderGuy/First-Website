    <pre id="Para2">
        Born in California, I grew up in the environment of creativity,
        so I hope to find a place in it. I strive to improve and create.
        Currently, I own a small commission business online,
        along with a small social media following.
        I'm grateful to be gaining any kind of experience online,
        and that there are people who enjoy art by me.
        I currently attend College, pursuing a degree in Computer Science
        with a minor in Studio Arts.
        I am working to be game designer and concept artist,
        and perhaps a web and developer.
        For my current business, I use Procreate, Clip Studio Paint, and Photoshop.
        As a hobby, I mess around with photography and cinematography,
        along with studying a small list of secondary languages including;
        Japanese, Chinese, and Korean.
        I sometimes mingle with 3D modeling and Animation, along with Photo Editing.
        I hope one day to work for some company that will let me have the freedom to
        create anything from my imagination,
        and create stories that can take people to other worlds.
        My goals are improve not only my creativity, but myself as a person.
